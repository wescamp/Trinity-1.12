removed "Dolevan waking Seth" crap.  Instead, Dolevan still wanders off and
frees Seth, but it takes longer.  Each branch has one scenario, then the
final scenario is the same for each, it's just a matter of which side you
play.

Pre-1 cutscene - Dolevan awakens Seth by experimenting upon a Khthon with info
from his brother.  Seth's ruins start to spread, including a large tower.
